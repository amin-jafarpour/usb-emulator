##### American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII)
- Character encoding standard that represents text using numeric codes.
- Logical representation of characters and not hardware specific.
- Standard range [0, 127].
- Extended range [0, 255].

##### Scan Codes
- Numeric codes sent by a keyboard when a key is pressed or released.
- Hardware dependent.
- Make codes sent when key is pressed. 
- Break codes sent when key is released. 
- Set1, set2, set3. 
- Set1 is used by BIOS.

#### USB HID Codes
- Part of the USB HID (Human Interface Device) standard. 
- HID Usage Tables define codes for input devices (keyboards, mice, etc.).
- Codes are abstract, and independent of OS or hardware scan code sets.
- OS maps USB HID codes to scan codes, and scan codes to ASCII codes.
- Used for keyboards, mice, jotsticks, etc.
#### USB Classes
- Mass Storage
- HID
- Audio 
- CDC (Communications Device Class)
#### USB HID Class
- Allows devices to send structured input data to the host and receive output reports from it. 
##### HID Report Descriptor
- data structure that describes the format and meaning of data packets the device will send or receive.
- What kind of data is available (e.g., X/Y position, button states)
- How big each field is in bits
##### HID Report Types
- Input Reports: Data sent from device to host (e.g., keypresses)
- Output Reports: Data sent from host to device (e.g., LED states)
- Feature Reports: Bi-directional data not time-critical (e.g., device configuration)




##### HID Report Descriptor
- Binary structure the device sends to describe its capabilities.
- E.g.,  number of buttons, axes, etc
##### HID Usage Tables
-  Assigns usage page codes to each buttons.

| Usage Page | Description              |
|------------|--------------------------|
| 0x01       | Generic Desktop Controls |
| 0x02       | Stimulation Controls     |
| 0x07       | Keyboard                 |
| 0x08       | LED                      |
| 0x09       | Button                   |


#### Modifier Keys
- Shift Key
- Control Key
- Alt Key
- Right Alt Key (AltGr)
- Command or âŒ˜ (MacOS)
- Function Key (Fn)
- Caps Key
##### Modifier Keys in USB HID 
- Modifier keys are bit flags in the HID report.
- The first byte of a USB HID keyboard report is reserved for modifier status.
- Keyboard sends modifier status byte along with up to 6 key usage codes.

| Bit | Modifier Key  |
|-----|---------------|
| 1   | Left Ctrl     |
| 2   | Left Shift    |
| 3   | Left Alt      |
| 4   | Power/cmd key |
| 5   | Right Shift   |
| 6   | Right Alt     |
| 7   | Right GUI     |
##### Modifiers in BIOS
- Modifier keys have their own scan codes like any other key.

| Hex Value | Key         |
|-----------|-------------|
| 0X2A      | Left Shift  |
| 0X36      | Right Shift |
| 0X1D      | Ctrl        |
| 0X38      | Alt         |


##### Control Characters
- Non-printing characters in character encoding systems.
- Perform certain actions rather than representing written symbols.
- E.g., moving cursor, signaling end-of-line, producing beeps.
